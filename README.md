# Horiseon Refactor

## Purpose
My goal was to refactor the Horiseon code to improve accessibility and increase SEO metrics.

## Deployed Webpage Link
https://jabrams513.github.io/Horiseon-Refactor/

## User Story
AS A marketing agency

I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards

SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code

THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the icon and image elements

THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes

THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Description of Code Refactoring
Created a unique title for the page.

Added alt elements for images to improve accessibility and SEO.

Avoided div soup by changing some elements to header, nav, main, section, aside, and footer in HTML. Made corresponding changes to CSS.

DRY'd the code by minimizing class and ID redundancies that affected the HTML and CSS.

Added notes and comments to HTML and CSS so collaborators and visitors could follow along.

## Code Sources and Collaborators
I had the opportunity to collaborate with my peer Mustapha. We checked our work with one another.

In addition, I received feedback from my instructor, Diego, and my TA, Andrew.

All code used was self-generated or otherwise gathered from class materials.
